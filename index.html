            <p>Hi, I am Gunjan, a passionate developer from India. My journey in tech began only a few months ago, but I
                have
                been determined to make a name for myself in this field. I am currently focusing on mastering web
                development
                and data structures and algorithms in C++. I believe that these are the building blocks of any
                successful
                developer and I am excited to see where they will take me.
                <br><br>
                My nearest goal is to contribute to open-source projects, as I believe that this is one of the best ways
                to
                give
                back to the community and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. Although I have not yet begun
                my
                journey in open source, I am eager to start and hope to be welcomed with open arms by the tech
                community.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my love for coding, I also enjoy attending tech meetups and seminars. I find them to be a
                great
                way to stay updated on the latest trends and technologies, and also to network with like-minded
                individuals.
                I
                also have a passion for reading books, and I enjoy expressing my thoughts and emotions through writing.
                I
                believe that reading and writing are essential for personal and professional growth.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I am excited to see where my tech journey takes me, and I am determined to make the most of
                every
                opportunity that comes my way. I am confident that with hard work and dedication, I will be able to
                achieve
                my
                goals and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. I hope to be able to share my knowledge and
                experiences
                with others, and to make a positive impact in the world through technology.
